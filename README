A collection of tcl scripts for eggdrop, none of them older than September 2017

| Script        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [googleTranslate.tcl](https://github.com/manavortex/eggdrop-scripts/blob/master/googleTranslate.tcl)  | google translate script, uses the internal API that the Google Chrome translation expansion uses. That way, there's no API key necessary.
Encoding problems fixed with #egghelp on freenet! |
| [urltitle.tcl](https://github.com/manavortex/eggdrop-scripts/blob/master/urltitle.tcl)      | Originally a fork of teel's urltitle - https://github.com/teeli/urltitle. Rewrote it to better suit my needs and added functionality from FAIN's tinyurl script to add a tinyurl if the original URL exceeds the limit. |
